# ABOUT THE APP
1. In this demo project I would like to show you how I prepare my folder structer and how the files are related to each other.

2. Functionality is not extended beacuse of API data lack. But the idea is simple and structured.

3. In the working sub category section, normally I do it with a state manager but for simplicity I did it with callbacks.
